Football Knowledge is a football quiz that consists of 50+ questions about different football facts. Football knowledge consists of two screens: the starter screen and the game screen. On the starter screen, there are instructions for gameplay and a button to start the quiz. On the game screen, there are 10 multiple-choice questions with 4 answers, with one of them being correct. After submitting, you can see your score and which answers were incorrect. You can try again using the try again button. On each try, the app shuffles the questions, so you can get different questions each time.
